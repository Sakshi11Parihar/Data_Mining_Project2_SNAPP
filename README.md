# Introduction

In the GitHub repository, you will discover code and comprehensive documentation related to our Data Mining course project. Our project's primary focus revolves around conducting an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developing classification models. Our objective is to offer a thorough comprehension of the dataset we have at hand, as well as construct and evaluate  models through a systematic approach. This project serves as a valuable opportunity for us to gain hands-on experience in handling data, preparing it for analysis by addressing data cleaning tasks, and systematically building and refining regression models. This practical endeavor enriches our understanding and expertise in the realm of data analysis and modeling.
